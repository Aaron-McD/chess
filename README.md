This is a playable game of chess on a linux console. That can currently accommodate two players.

It follows all of the current rules of chess as far as I am aware of, including castling and en passant captures.

You can save the state of the game at any point while playing and reload it at a different date.

To play you simply need a linux console with ruby installed and git. Fork off your own version of this file and pull the repository onto your computer. Then simply type into the console 'ruby main.rb' and it will take care of the rest.
